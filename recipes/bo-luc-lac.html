        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Seared, fatty ribeye with aromatic onions paired with the sweet and citric flavors of tomato rice. Can you feel your mouth watering? Bò lúc lắc is a very accessible dish because it has the familiar taste of steak and onions with a twist. It’s most popularly called “shaking beef,” but makes more sense as “shaken beef” to me (because it’s obviously not quivering on the plate).

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Shaking Beef</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients and beef except for the cornstarch in a bowl and marinate for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>While this marinates, wash and prep all the veggies.</li>
            <li>Before cooking, transfer the beef to another plate to remove excess liquid and to come to room temp for about an hour.</li>
            <li>Coat each piece of beef in cornstarch. Heat a pan on medium high or high, then brown the meat on all sides in about 2-4 batches depending on the size of your pan.</li>
            <li>Once you have cooked all your beef, add them into a pan with the vegetables over medium-low heat, and stir for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Plate the veggies and beef. Add some Maggi to salt to taste.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Tomato Rice</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare and cook 1 c of rice as you would normally. I like to use a rice cooker and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>In a large pan over medium heat, add oil and garlic until fragrant and brown. Stir the garlic so it doesn’t burn.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and stir thoroughly to coat with the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and continue to stir to incorporate the red coloring evenly throughout the rice.</li>
            <li>Add a few splashes of fish sauce and taste the rice. I would start with two dashes and build from there, you don’t want to add too much saltiness since this will be eaten with the beef.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Vegetables</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and prep all vegetables.</li>
            <li>Put 1 tbsp of oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and bell peppers. Saute for about 2 minutes until the onions turn slightly translucent, but not too soft.</li>
            <li>Add green onions last to prevent them from wilting, stir to mix.</li>
            <li>Remove the vegetables and place aside in a bowl. You will be mixing these again with the beef.</li>
        </ol>
