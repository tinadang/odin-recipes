        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Phở is a Vietnamese noodle soup that is made with thin rice noodles, various types of meats like chicken or brisket, bean sprouts, and a handful of herbs. Chicken phở is similar to its American cousin chicken soup; It’s comforting, filling, but has a different blend of aromatics and spices. This soup tastes fresher since the veggies and herbs aren’t stewed, but instead added in right before serving.

            <li>Thai basil</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Aromatics and Spices</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On a sheet pan, roast the aromatics in the middle rack of an oven on 375°F to 400°F for 15-30 minutes or until dark brown but not blackened.</li>
            <li>Wrap the spices in foil and bake 350°F for 5 minutes (or roast on a pan medium heat until lightly browned and aromatic).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Pho Ga</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the aromatics, spices, and all soup ingredients into a large stock pot and bring to a boil on high heat. Once it hits a boil, lower the heat to maintain a low boil and cook the chicken for 25-40 minutes until the chicken is cooked all the way through. You can use a thermometer to make sure the internal temperature reads 165°F (or the juices run clear when you cut into the deepest part of the chicken).</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken once done and rinse under cold water for one minute to cool. This will prevent the chicken from getting dark. Once the chicken has cooled, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Cook the rice noodles according to package instructions only just before you’re ready to serve it. Cooking the noodles usually take about 5 minutes after boiling the water.</li>
            <li>To assemble, start with portioning the noodles into a bowl, and then add the soup, shredded chicken, and accoutrements on top. The proportions of this entire recipe is purely a personalized one, but check the photos as a guide.</li>
        </ol>
